# 💳 Mini ATM Simulation (C++ Console Application)

A simple C++ console-based ATM simulation that mimics basic banking operations like balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, mobile number update, and user authentication.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 PIN Authentication
- 💰 Balance Inquiry
- 💸 Cash Withdrawal (with validation)
- 📱 Mobile Number Update
- 👤 User Details Display

## 🛠️ Built With

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Console I/O (`cin`, `cout`)
- Basic Control Structures (loops, conditionals)

## 📦 Project Structure

```
main.cpp        # Entry point of the program
atm class       # Defines account details and operations
```

## ✅ How It Works

1. User enters their **Account Number** and **PIN**.
2. If valid, they can:
   - View balance
   - Withdraw cash
   - View account details
   - Update mobile number
3. Loop continues until the user exits.

## 📸 Sample Output

```
**** ATM ****
Enter Account No.: 123456789
Enter PIN: 1234

**** Welcome to ATM ****
1. Check Balance
2. Cash Withdraw
3. Show User Details
4. Update Mobile No.
5. Exit
```
